## HTML Viewer Components for Delphi, Lazarus and C++Builder ##

The HtmlViewer component set consists of the THtmlViewer, TFrameViewer,
and TFrameBrowser components. All three are HTML document display components:

THtmlViewer
  * The basic component.
  * THtmlViewer displays single (non-frame) documents.
  * It also forms the basis for the other two components.

TFrameViewer
  * Displays both frame and single HTML documents.
  * TFrameViewer is oriented more for local file system use.

TFrameBrowser
  * Also displays frame and single HTML documents.
  * TFrameBrower is oriented for use with local file systems and toward Internet style protocols and URL usage.
  * Additional code and/or components are generally required to get data from other sources than the local file system.

These components support most of the HTML 3.2 specifications with many
additional popular HTML 4 and 5 enhancements.
Many Cascading Style Sheet properties are also supported.

For a detailed list and demonstration of features start "FrameDem.exe".

## Project History ##

The well-known HTMLViewer components previously sold by PBear.com are in the public domain since 2008!

To ensure that these components stay usable for a long time to come, we (the HTMLViewer project team) will be maintaining it's codebase from now on.

As of 2009-07-10 this project replaced the SF hosted HTMLViewer project, which now hosts the releases only.

We'd like to thank the original author of the HTMLViewer components, David Baldwin, for all his hard work and his generous donation of this code to the public domain!
